        Water is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and almost colorless chemical substance and covers over 70% 
of Earth's surface. No known life can live without it.Lakes, oceans, seas, and rivers are made of water. Precipitation is water that falls from clouds 
in the sky. It may be rain (liquid) if it is warm, or it may be frozen if it is cold. If water gets very
 cold (below 0 째C (32 째F)), it freezes and becomes ice, the frozen variant of water. If water gets very 
 hot (above 100 째C (212 째F)), it boils and becomes steam or water vapor.It is moved around in the water 
 cycle. Water is essential for life.

        Helianthus is a genus comprising about 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the 
        daisy family Asteraceae. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are
        native to North America and Central America. The common names "sunflower" and "common sunflower" 
        typically refer to the popular annual species Helianthus annuus, whose round flower heads in
        combination with the ligules look like the sun. This and other species, notably Jerusalem 
        artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions as food 
        crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically
        grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
